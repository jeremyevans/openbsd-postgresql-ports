These are ports for old versions of PostgreSQL, useful for testing old
versions or possibly for pg_upgrade.  To use, clone this repository
into /usr/ports/mystuff/databases/postgresql-old.

Versions 8.2-9.0 must run with _postgresql as the database superuser,
instead of the default of postgres.

Here's some code to setup databases for all of these versions:

  for x in 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 10 11 12 13; do
    doas -u _postgresql /usr/local/bin/postgresql-$x/initdb -D /var/postgresql/data-$x -U postgres -E UTF8
  done
  for x in 8.2 8.3 8.4 9.0; do
    doas -u _postgresql /usr/local/bin/postgresql-$x/initdb -D /var/postgresql/data-$x -E UTF8
  done

You'll want to go into postgresql.conf in each directory and change the
port if you want to run versions in parallel.

Note that older versions need kern.shminfo.shmmax increased, in addition to
kern.seminfo.semmni and kern.seminfo.semmns.
